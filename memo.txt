The void holds no safe passage for error
Purpose is the northern star
Uncertaintiy will lead to dispair
The clamour of forgotten nightmares
Fills the vaccuum like water

I thin thread is drawn in the distance
A dull metallic glimmer 
But a floodlight in the void 
Before the merge comes the surge

The was a memory of light but no
But the void was too present
Hope came and went in an instant
Sight was no sound, sound was now fear
